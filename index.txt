I am a Program Analysis Engineer at [Coana](https://coana.tech).

I am interested in programming languages (*semantics, design, implementation, type systems, program analysis*) and computer security (*information-flow, language-based security, online security, covert channels*).

I have a PhD in Computer Science from [Aarhus University](https://au.dk), where I was advised by [Aslan Askarov](https://askarov.net).
