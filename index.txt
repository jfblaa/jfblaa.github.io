I am a PhD student under advisor [Aslan Askarov](https://askarov.net) in the
[Logic and Semantics group](http://cs.au.dk/research/logic-and-semantics/)
at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.au.dk) at
[Aarhus University](https://au.dk).

I research programming languages (*semantics, design, type systems, program analysis*) and computer security (*information-flow, language-based security, online security, covert channels*).
I am particularly interested in languaged-based methods for online security.

I am additionally interested in functional programming, low-level programming, and compilers.
