I am a recent PhD from the [Logic and Semantics group](http://cs.au.dk/research/logic-and-semantics/)
 at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.au.dk) at
[Aarhus University](https://au.dk), where I was advised by [Aslan Askarov](https://askarov.net).
I now work as a Program Analysis Engineer at [Coana](https://coana.tech).

I am interested in programming languages (*semantics, design, implementation, type systems, program analysis*) and computer security (*information-flow, language-based security, online security, covert channels*).

Additionally, I am fond of functional programming, low-level programming, and compilers.
